ZF2 playground.

ln -s the zf2 library to library/Zend

ln -s the bin folder from zf2 to bin/

run classmaps.php from the console to generate all the classmaps
for the autoloader

use the schema/data from the db directory

if you get a "Warning: require_once(Zend/Controller/Router/Route/Module.php): failed to open stream: No such file or directory"
error you might try commenting out line 97 in library/Zend/Controller/Router/Rewrite.php

hack away!
